### About me

📈 I'm a sport scientist from Spain, currently living in the US.  
💻 I tend to do most of my data work combining R & SQL.  
🤳🏻 I’m currently learning IOS development, especially SwiftUI and ARKit frameworks.  
🛠 I mostly share learning resources, code snippets and ocassionally sport related R packages & Shiny apps here on GitHub.  
💬 I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jfernandez__)
